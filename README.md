## DES Encryption - Verilog
The DES algorithm have played an important role in the developement of the Cryptography algorithms ([Read more on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Encryption_Standard)).
This Verilog code implements a Verilog unit for this algorithm.

## How to Use
Create a new project in your desired synthesis or simulation tool, and add all 
".v" files to your project. Remember to choose "DES_Encryption.v" as the top-level module.
The project is tested on Altera Quartus Prime Lite Edition v16.1.
